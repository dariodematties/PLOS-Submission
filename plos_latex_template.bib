abstract="The introduction of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based acoustic models has produced dramatic improvements in performance. In particular, we have recently found that Deep Maxout Networks, a modification of DNNs' feed-forward architecture that uses a max-out activation function, provides enhanced robustness to environmental noise. In this paper we further investigate how these improvements are translated into the different broad phonetic classes and how does it compare to classical Hidden Markov Models (HMM) based back-ends. Our experiments demonstrate that performance is still tightly related to the particular phonetic class being stops and affricates the least resilient but also that relative improvements of both DNN variants are distributed unevenly across those classes having the type of noise a significant influence on the distribution. A combination of the different systems DNN and classical HMM is also proposed to validate our hypothesis that the traditional GMM/HMM systems have a different type of error than the Deep Neural Networks hybrid models.",

	abstract = {Working memory refers to the ability of the brain to store and manipulate information over brief time periods, ranging from seconds to minutes. As opposed to long-term memory, which is critically dependent upon hippocampal processing, critical substrates for working memory are distributed in a modality-specific fashion throughout cortex. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play a crucial role in the initiation of long-term memory. Neurochemical mechanisms underlying the transient memory storage required for working memory, however, remain obscure. Auditory sensory memory, which refers to the ability of the brain to retain transient representations of the physical features (e.g., pitch) of simple auditory stimuli for periods of up to approximately 30 sec, represents one of the simplest components of the brain working memory system. Functioning of the auditory sensory memory system is indexed by the generation of a well-defined event-related potential, termed mismatch negativity (MMN). MMN can thus be used as an objective index of auditory sensory memory functioning and a probe for investigating underlying neurochemical mechanisms. Monkeys generate cortical activity in response to deviant stimuli that closely resembles human MMN. This study uses a combination of intracortical recording and pharmacological micromanipulations in awake monkeys to demonstrate that both competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists block the generation of MMN without affecting prior obligatory activity in primary auditory cortex. These findings suggest that, on a neurophysiological level, MMN represents selective current flow through open, unblocked NMDA channels. Furthermore, they suggest a crucial role of cortical NMDA receptors in the assessment of stimulus familiarity/unfamiliarity, which is a key process underlying working memory performance.},

Here we show that the cellular architecture of cortical {\textquotedblleft}barrel{\textquotedblright} columns in rodent somatosensory cortex is not stereotypic, but specific for each whisker on the animals{\textquoteright} snout. Our findings challenge the concepts underlying contemporary simulation efforts that build up large-scale network models of repeatedly occurring identical cortical circuits.The cellular organization of the cortex is of fundamental importance for elucidating the structural principles that underlie its functions. It has been suggested that reconstructing the structure and synaptic wiring of the elementary functional building block of mammalian cortices, the cortical column, might suffice to reverse engineer and simulate the functions of entire cortices. In the vibrissal area of rodent somatosensory cortex, whisker-related {\textquotedblleft}barrel{\textquotedblright} columns have been referred to as potential cytoarchitectonic equivalents of functional cortical columns. Here, we investigated the structural stereotypy of cortical barrel columns by measuring the 3D neuronal composition of the entire vibrissal area in rat somatosensory cortex and thalamus. We found that the number of neurons per cortical barrel column and thalamic {\textquotedblleft}barreloid{\textquotedblright} varied substantially within individual animals, increasing by \~{}2.5-fold from dorsal to ventral whiskers. As a result, the ratio between whisker-specific thalamic and cortical neurons was remarkably constant. Thus, we hypothesize that the cellular architecture of sensory cortices reflects the degree of similarity in sensory input and not columnar and/or cortical uniformity principles.},

    abstract = { The ability to recognize and predict temporal sequences of sensory inputs is vital for survival in natural environments. Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory recently has been proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this letter, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive integrated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams. }

ABSTRACT={Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.}

abstract = "When listening to speech under adverse conditions, expectancies resulting from semantic context can have a strong impact on comprehension. Here we ask how minimal variations in semantic context (cloze probability) affect the unfolding comprehension of acoustically degraded speech. Three main results are observed in the brain electric response. First, auditory evoked responses to a degraded sentence's onset (N100) correlate with participants' comprehension scores, but are generally more vigorous for more degraded sentences. Second, a pronounced N400 in response to low-cloze sentence-final words, reflecting the integration effort of words into context, increases linearly with improving speech intelligibility. Conversely, transient enhancement in Gamma band power (γ, ~40–70Hz) during high-cloze sentence-final words (~600ms) reflects top-down-facilitated integration. This γ-band effect also varies parametrically with signal quality. Third, a negative correlation of N100 amplitude at sentence onset and the later γ-band response is found in moderately degraded speech. This reflects two partly distinct neural strategies when dealing with moderately degraded speech; a more “bottom-up,” resource-allocating, and effortful versus a more “top-down,” associative and facilitatory strategy. Results also emphasize the non-redundant contributions of phase-locked (evoked) and non-phase-locked (induced) oscillatory brain dynamics in auditory EEG."

abstract = "Iconic gestures are spontaneous hand movements that illustrate certain contents of speech and, as such, are an important part of face-to-face communication. This experiment targets the brain bases of how iconic gestures and speech are integrated during comprehension. Areas of integration were identified on the basis of two classic properties of multimodal integration, bimodal enhancement and inverse effectiveness (i.e., greater enhancement for unimodally least effective stimuli). Participants underwent fMRI while being presented with videos of gesture-supported sentences as well as their unimodal components, which allowed us to identify areas showing bimodal enhancement. Additionally, we manipulated the signal-to-noise ratio of speech (either moderate or good) to probe for integration areas exhibiting the inverse effectiveness property. Bimodal enhancement was found at the posterior end of the superior temporal sulcus and adjacent superior temporal gyrus (pSTS/STG) in both hemispheres, indicating that the integration of iconic gestures and speech takes place in these areas. Furthermore, we found that the left pSTS/STG specifically showed a pattern of inverse effectiveness, i.e., the neural enhancement for bimodal stimulation was greater under adverse listening conditions. This indicates that activity in this area is boosted when an iconic gesture accompanies an utterance that is otherwise difficult to comprehend. The neural response paralleled the behavioral data observed. The present data extends results from previous gesture–speech integration studies in showing that pSTS/STG plays a key role in the facilitation of speech comprehension through simultaneous gestural input."

This functional magnetic resonance imaging study examines how semantic expectancy (“cloze probability”) in variably intelligible sentences (“noise vocoding”) modulates the brain bases of comprehension. First, intelligibility-modulated activation along the superior temporal sulci (STS) was extended anteriorly and posteriorly in low-cloze sentences (e.g., “she weighs the flour”) but restricted to a mid-superior temporal gyrus/STS area in more predictable high-cloze sentences (e.g., “she sifts the flour”). Second, the degree of left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (Brodmann's area 44) involvement in processing low-cloze constructions was proportional to increasing intelligibility. Left inferior parietal cortex (IPC; angular gyrus) activation accompanied successful speech comprehension that derived either from increased signal quality or from semantic facilitation. The results show that successful decoding of speech in auditory cortex areas regulates language-specific computation (left IFG and IPC). In return, semantic expectancy can constrain these speech-decoding processes, with fewer neural resources being allocated to highly predictable sentences. These findings offer an important contribution toward the understanding of the functional neuroanatomy in speech comprehension.}",

This study, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, investigated the neural basis of this interaction with two speech manipulations, one acoustic (spectral degradation) and the other cognitive (semantic predictability). High compared with low predictability resulted in the greatest improvement in comprehension at an intermediate level of degradation, and this was associated with increased activity in the left angular gyrus, the medial and left lateral prefrontal cortices, and the posterior cingulate gyrus. Functional connectivity between these regions was also increased, particularly with respect to the left angular gyrus. In contrast, activity in both superior temporal sulci and the left inferior frontal gyrus correlated with the amount of spectral detail in the speech signal, regardless of predictability. These results demonstrate that increasing functional connectivity between high-order cortical areas, remote from the auditory cortex, facilitates speech comprehension when the clarity of speech is reduced.},

Visual cells with long conduction latencies and large contralateral receptive fields can also be recorded in primary auditory cortex. Some visual cells in auditory cortex are direction selective or have oriented receptive fields that resemble those of complex cells in primary visual cortex. Thus, functional visual projections can be routed into nonvisual structures in higher mammals, suggesting that the modality of a sensory thalamic nucleus or cortical area may be specified by its inputs during development.},

abstract = {Abstract Following specific neonatal brain lesions in rodents and ferrets, retinal axons have been induced to innervate the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Previous studies have suggested that reduction of normal retinal targets along with deafferentation of the MGN are two concurrent factors required for the induction of novel retino-MGN projections. We have examined, in ferrets, the relative influence of these two factors on the extent of the novel retinal projection. We first characterized the inputs to the normal MGN, and the most effective combination of neonatal lesions to deafferent this nucleus, by injecting retrograde tracers into the MGN of normal and neonatally operated adult ferrets, respectively. In a second group of experiments, newborn ferrets received different combinations of lesions of normal retinal targets and MGN afferents. The resulting extent of retino-MGN projections was estimated for each case at adulthood, by using intraocular injections of anterograde tracers. We found that the extent of retino-MGN projections correlates well with the extent of MGN deafferentation, but not with extent of removal of normal retinal targets. Indeed, the presence of at least some normal retinal targets seems necessary for the formation of retino-MGN connections. The diameters of retino-MGN axons suggest that more than one type of retinal ganglion cells innervate the MGN under a lesion paradigm that spares the visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus. We also found that, after extensive deafferentation of MGN, other axonal systems in addition to retinal axons project ectopically to the MGN. These data are consistent with the idea that ectopic retino-MGN projections develop by sprouting of axon collaterals in response to signals arising from the deafferented nucleus, and that these axons compete with other sets of axons for terminal space in the MGN.

	abstract = {Maps of sensory surfaces are a fundamental feature of sensory cortical areas of the brain. The relative roles of afferents and targets in forming neocortical maps in higher mammals can be examined in ferrets in which retinal inputs are directed into the auditory pathway. In these animals, the primary auditory cortex contains a systematic representation of the retina (and of visual space) rather than a representation of the cochlea (and of sound frequency). A representation of a two-dimensional sensory epithelium, the retina, in cortex that normally represents a one-dimensional epithelium, the cochlea, suggests that the same cortical area can support different types of maps. Topography in the visual map arises both from thalamocortical projections that are characteristic of the auditory pathway and from patterns of retinal activity that provide the input to the map.},

    abstract = { The temporal properties of speech appear to play a more important role in linguistic contrasts than has hitherto been appreciated. Therefore, a new framework for describing the acoustic structure of speech based purely on temporal aspects has been developed. From this point of view, speech can be said to be comprised of three main temporal features, based on dominant fluctuation rates: envelope, periodicity, and fine-structure. Each feature has distinct acoustic manifestations, auditory and perceptual correlates, and roles in linguistic contrasts. The applicability of this three-featured temporal system is discussed in relation to hearing-impaired and normal listeners. }

In the present paper a multiple test procedure allowing statements on individual hypotheses is proposed. It is based on the principle of closed test procedures (Marcus, Peritz \\&amp; Gabriel, 1976) and controls the multiple level α.}",
